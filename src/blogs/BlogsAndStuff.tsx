          So over the last year and a half, I have had this idea of maintaining
          a blog, but I never got to it. With the COVID-19 pandemic looming over
          our heads, I finally got to making one.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was rather confusing as to how I would go about it. I had earlier
          tried making one using WordPress but I never got really into it. Then
          I came across the concept of static site generators. I just picked
          Hugo as the tech I would use and start working on this blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          And well here we are. I&#39;ll keep working on the styling of this,
          but I think the current theme works for the right now.
        </p>
        <h3 id="what-is-the-blog-about-">What is the blog about?</h3>
        <p>
          This is a free flowing blog. You&#39;ll find me post about topics such
          as music, projects that I am working on and my opinions on completely
          random stuff.
        </p>
        <p>So I hope to see you sticking around!</p>
