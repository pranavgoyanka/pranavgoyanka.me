        I am a software developer with over 2 years of experience specializing
        in Distributed Systems and backend engineering. I have recently
        graduated from the Master of Science in Computer Science at Boston
        University, where I am also conducted research on stream processing
        engines to optimize resource utilization. In addition to my academic
        focus, I served a teaching assistant and course designer for the
        graduate Distributed Systems course.
