        I am an Associate Software Developer at Goldman Sachs with 
        3 years of experience specializing
        in distributed systems and backend engineering. I graduated
        with a Master of Science in Computer Science from Boston University,
        where I also conducted research on stream processing engines to optimize
        resource utilization on edge devices. In addition to my academic focus,
        I served as a teaching assistant and course designer for the
        graduate-level Distributed Systems course. I am also active in the
        open-source community and have participated in and mentored for Google
        Summer of Code.
